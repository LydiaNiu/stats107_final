##How do different sleep disorders (Insomnia vs. Sleep Apnea) differ in sleep quality and stress level?

# 1. Variables:

  - Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

  - Quality of Sleep (Scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

  - Stress Level (Scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.


# 2. Hypotheses:
All the following tests will use t-test to compare the differences of the two means.


  1) Null Hypothesis (H₀₁) : sleep quality of sleep apnea vs sleep quality of insomia
  
      - There is no significant difference in sleep quality between people with Sleep Apnea and those with Insomnia.

  2) Null Hypothesis (H₀₂) : stress level of sleep apnea vs stress level of insomia

      - There is no significant difference in stress levels between people with Sleep Apnea and those with Insomnia.

  3) Null Hypothesis (H₀₃) : 

     - There is no significant difference in sleep quality between people with No Sleep Disorder and those with Insomnia.

  4) Null Hypothesis (H₀₄) : 

     - There is no significant difference in sleep quality between people with No Sleep Disorder and those with Sleep Apnea.

  5) Null Hypothesis (H₀₅) :
  
     - There is no significant difference in stress levels between people with No Sleep Disorder and those with Insomnia.
  
  6) Null Hypothesis (H₀₆) :
  
     - There is no significant difference in stress levels between people with No Sleep Disorder and those with Sleep Apnea.
