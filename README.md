1. Variables:

Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

Quality of Sleep (Scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

Stress Level (Scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.

2. Hypotheses:

    a. Null Hypothesis (H₀₁)

     - Statement: There is no significant difference in stress levels between individuals with Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.

     - Test: Test of difference of two means

     - Since the two variables are continuous and categorical, where stress level is measured on a scale (1-10) and sleeping disorders are categorical (Sleep Apnea vs. Insomnia), a t-test would be appropriate.

    b. Null Hypothesis (H₀₂)

     - Statement: There is no significant difference in sleep quality between individuals with Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.

     - Test: Test of difference of two means

     - Similar to the first null hypothesis.
