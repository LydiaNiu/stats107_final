##How do different sleep disorders (Insomnia vs. Sleep Apnea) differ in sleep quality and stress level?

1. Variables:

Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

Quality of Sleep (Scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

Stress Level (Scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.

2. Hypotheses:

  a. Null Hypothesis (H₀₁)

    - Statement: There is no significant difference in stress levels between individuals with Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.

Test: Test of difference of two means

Since the two variables are continuous and categorical, where stress level is measured on a scale (1-10) and sleeping disorders are categorical (Sleep Apnea vs. Insomnia), a t-test would be appropriate.

b. Null Hypothesis (H₀₂)

Statement: There is no significant difference in sleep quality between individuals with Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.

Test: Test of difference of two means

Similar to the first null hypothesis.

c. Null Hypothesis (H₀₃)

Statement: Stress level and sleep quality are not significantly correlated in individuals with Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.

Test: Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)

Since both variables (stress level and sleep quality) are continuous, Pearson’s correlation test will be used to measure the linear relationship between them.

d. Null Hypothesis (H₀₄)

Statement: Comparison of individuals with sleep disorders to those without disorders.

Analysis: The study examines individuals with insomnia to determine if there is a significant change in both stress level and sleep quality compared to those without sleep disorders.
